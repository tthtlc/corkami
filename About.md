Corkami is my notepad, and doesn't follow a clear roadmap: I try to organize some of my knowledge in a useful way (so that I can re-use it myself), and I share it.

Corkami is:
  * **technical**
    * based on findings on real hardware
    * confirmed with many PoCs
  * **free**
    * to browse (no annoying layout, no ads, ...)
    * to download (no login required)
    * to test (pre-compiled PoCs included)
    * to modify (BSD Licence, complete sources included, even for pictures and documents, using open-source tools)
  * **useful**
    * constantly updated (wiki format)
      * always public, thus subject to feedback: correction, suggestion, etc...
    * binaries are directly downloadable
    * binaries are hand made to be concise
    * printable documents (cheat sheets, diagrams, tables) to use daily at work

the way I work:
  1. I study a specific topic (PDF, PE, x86...)
  1. when I learn something new, I code a small PoC that just focuses on this specific point
  1. when I have enough PoCs, I write a **wiki page** for it (but my PoCs are the most up to date part, so be sure to check the nightly builds!)
  1. everything is public, thus commented, corrected, noticed by the community
  1. when my coverage of the topic is good enough, I apply to **present** in a conference.

Hope you like it,

# landmarks #
## from 2013 to 2014 ##
  * 2013 was quite intensive:
    * 5 distinct materials, 8 presentations in 5 countries.
    * 6 new posters, and 7 alternate versions.
    * 4 articles
  * getting some recognition: first poster request, first custom binary requests...
  * plan for 2014: much less traveling (strict minimum?), more focus on work.
## step ? (2013) ##
  * starting early, presenting on puzzles at Hackpra in January.
  * 'back to France' - will apply to present at HES, SSTIC, HiP - pour essayer de se reconnecter au pays ;)
  * more graphs, more topics, more PoCs. same old. my usual style ;)

## step 1.6 (2012/12/31) ##
  * 2012 is soon over, it was a great year:
    * Reworked the [BerlinSides](http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/BerlinSidesX2) page to integrate the notes and screencasts. Nice all-in-one layout, but I now prefer the double deck (see below)
    * improved the [PE](PE.md) page with many examples, animations and screencasts.
    * [Opcodes' tables](OpcodesTables.md) for Android/JVM/.NET/x86.
    * the [PE 101](PE101.md) poster, first in 32b then in 64b, in 9 languages, including Arabic and Japanese, and then later in a lighter 'xkcd' version.
    * [CorkaMIX](http://code.google.com/p/corkami/downloads/detail?name=CorkaMIX.zip), my all-in-one PDF/Java/HTML/... file in a PE, followed by its Linux counterpart, [CorkaMInuX](http://code.google.com/p/corkami/downloads/detail?name=CorkaMInuX.zip).
    * the [PDF](http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/PDFTricks?wl=en) page also got some improvments.
    * the [initial values](InitialValues.md) got also a huge update.
  * Presentations on PE at [Hack in Paris](HackInParis2012.md) then [Hashdays](hashdays2012.md), which introduced a dual slide-deck release, which should be my standard from now on.
  * met a lot of nice people - thanks a lot everybody for 2012!

## step 1.5 (2011/12/30) ##
  * Thanks to Candid Wüest and FX for pushing me (I initially didn't plan that at all, in both cases), I presented at [Hashdays](http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/hashdays2011) and [BerlinSides](http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/BerlinSidesX2).
    * Both were great experiences, and as things went not too wrong, I had a good time, while being able to express myself freely, and experimenting on making presentations.
    * I spend maybe too much time on them, but I have my own personal style now, and I'll definitely reiterate the experience next year.

This unplanned extra step makes this year 2011 even better. It was great altogether!
## step 1 (2011/10/14) ##
  * the basics are now covered: [x86](x86oddities.md) and [PE](PE.md).
  * the style of publication reached a suitable form:
    * wiki pages with proof of concepts, and quoted snippets of code ([PE](PE.md), [x86](x86oddities.md) [PDF](PDFTricks.md))
    * pdf made from svg ([cheat sheets](http://code.google.com/p/corkami/downloads/list?q=pdf))
    * screencasts, with Wink ([reJava](http://rejava.sourceforge.net/hello.html) [OllyDbg tracing](https://sites.google.com/site/corkami/ollydbg-tracing))

so Corkami can step up and move on to the next level, following the same methods but tackling more advanced topics such as malware/packer analysis.
