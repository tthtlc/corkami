**Son, what’s a computer virus?**

A computer program that does something malicious.

**Why would someone create that?**

There can be many reasons, but an easy one is: for money! Since people connect to their bank account with their computer via the Internet, a virus can steal money by wiring it somewhere else. Like a guy who’s spying on your PIN at the ATM.

**But if you have a virus on the computer, you can see it, no?**

If the virus is good enough, no.

**Some people make good viruses?**

Some people earn a lot of money with them, so they make good viruses.

**But, how do you get a virus on your computer?**

Someone puts a fake message somewhere, asking you to click, and `*`boom`*`, you’re infected.

**So there is nothing that can tell you if a program is malicious?**

There are programs for that. They’re called ‘antivirus’.

**So with an anti-virus, you’re safe?**

Hopefully, yes. But sometimes, they can get through the cracks, or if your antivirus is too old.

**So in the end, you just have to be careful, like in real life?**

Sadly, that’s not enough. Sometimes, there are mistakes in your computer programs. Big mistakes that someone can use to put a virus on your computer remotely.

**Then, we can’t do anything?**

Normally, these mistakes are quickly fixed. But you have to update your computer yourself, otherwise you’ll still be in danger.

**Update what?**

The programs that you use regularly on your computer... Windows, Acrobat, Flash, Java,

**But if you are worried about something, just use an antivirus, no?**

If there is already a virus on your computer, and it’s an advanced one, no. It’s too late.

**Then, the only choice is to completely reset the computer?**

If it’s a very advanced virus, no. It’s too late anyway.


**So, to be safe, we need to update regularly, have an anti-virus program, and be careful ?**

Exactly! If any of the 3 are missing, you're at risk.
